# Revision-Logger
A time management tool for revision.

You can add subjects, set revision time goals and track your progress for each subject.\n
The program saves your log to file so you can come back at a later date.

Download both files and place them in the same folder.\n
Then, right click on the .py file and find the option 'Create Shortcut', and move the resulting shortcut somewhere on the desktop.\n
Double-clicking on the shortcut should open the tool.\n

If the program doesn't open, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version. Install Python.\n
Next, in Command Prompt, type the command `pip install tkinter` to install the TKinter library, which the tool is built on.\n
The program should now open properly.

Thanks!
